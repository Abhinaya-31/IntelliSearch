# IntelliSearch 🚀
## AI-Powered Semantic Search Engine

IntelliSearch is a smart AI-powered semantic search platform that enables users to search using natural language. By understanding context and intent rather than just keywords, it delivers precise and meaningful results.

The platform goes beyond traditional keyword matching by using vector embeddings to understand semantic meaning. When a user enters a query, it is converted into a vector and compared with stored document vectors using cosine similarity.

MongoDB Atlas is used as the backend database for storing documents and performing fast vector similarity search, while React powers the frontend interface and analytics dashboard.

## 📌 Project Overview

Modern organizations generate large volumes of data. Traditional search systems often fail because they rely only on exact keyword matching.

IntelliSearch solves this problem using:

- Vector Embeddings  
- Semantic Similarity Matching  
- AI-based Query Understanding  
- Intelligent Search Analytics  

It transforms traditional search into a smart, context-aware knowledge discovery system.

## 🧠 How IntelliSearch Works

### 1️⃣ Data Ingestion
Documents are processed and converted into vector embeddings (numerical representations of semantic meaning).

### 2️⃣ Query Processing
When a user enters a search query, it is converted into a vector representation.

### 3️⃣ Similarity Matching
The system compares the query vector with stored document vectors using cosine similarity to find the most relevant matches.

### 4️⃣ Continuous Learning
User interactions, saved searches, and feedback help improve ranking and relevance over time.
